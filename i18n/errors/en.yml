      The target does not have chef-client installed.

      This command is powered by the Chef client.  In order to make use of it
      on this node, the Chef client must be installed first.

      Re-running this command without the '--no-install' flag will
      automatically perform the installation.

  CHEFINS003: |
    The target's installed version of Chef Client is too old.

    Version %1 is installed, but this command requires a
    minimum version of %2 (Chef 13) or %3 (Chef 14).

  CHEFINS004: |
    The target's installed version of Chef Client is too old.

    Version %1 is installed, but this command requires a
    minimum version of %2.

  CHEFINS003:

      Password required for sudo.

      This target requires a password to perform sudo operations.  Please provide a
      password using the --sudo-password option. For example if the sudo password is
      in the environment variable $CHEF_RUN_SUDO_PASSWORD, you could use:

      --sudo-password $CHEF_RUN_SUDO_PASSWORD

      sudo requires tty on this system

      In order to continue, sudo must be configured to no longer require tty.
      You can do this by modifying /etc/sudoers:

      For all users:
        Defaults !requiretty

      Per-user:
        Defaults:username !requiretty

  CHEFTRN007:

      - Enable ssh-agent and add keys
      - Add a host entry to your ssh configuration
