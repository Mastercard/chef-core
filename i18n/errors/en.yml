# Error definitions, usage Text.e.ERR999
#
# General format:
# ERRORID
#   options: a stringified hash containing a optional hash of display options. See display_defaults below.
#   text: |
#      text of the message
#
# First Line: brief description of the error
# Second line: blank
# Third+ : detailed description, max 76 characters per line

# Pluralizing Messages
# If the text of an error differs based on quantity of subject,
# you can specify different messages as follows:
# ERRORID
#   text: !!pl
#     0: You have no things.
#     1: You have one thing.
#     n: You have lots of things.
# Text.ERRORID(quanity, [other formatting params])

errors:

  # These are the default display attributes for all messages.
  # If you want to override them in your gem or application,
  # include 'errors' -> 'display_defaults' in your gem's i18n/errors/*.yml
  # and enable it iwth Text.add_localization(path_to_yml)
  # The most recent gem to add its own error translations will take precedence.
  #
  # If you want to override them for specific errors in your error yml,
  # you can do so as follows:
  # EXAMPLERROR001:
  #   options: { decorations: false }
  #   text: |
  #     Here is the message text.
  display_defaults:
    # Set 'decorations: false' in a message to show only text. Equivalent
    # to setting all of the other attributes to false individually
    # stack: show reference to stack trace location in footer
    # log: show reference to log file location in footer
    # header: Show error header (currently bolded error id)
    # footer: show standard footer
    #
    # This (end error 'options') are kept as YML strings that are parsed when
    # the error is to be rendered.
    # Using a string type is necessary bedcause we don't have access to the
    # underlying tree structure via R18n.
    "{ decorations: true, stack: false, log: false, header: true, footer: true }"


  # Error headers and footers that are included with error messages will default to the
  # text below. You can override this in your gem's localization, but make sure
  # that you don't add additional argument placeholders (eg %3 if the original message
  # only has %1 and %2) - they won't be populated since chef_core doesn't know about them.

      Password required for sudo.

      This target requires a password to perform sudo operations.  Please provide a
      password using the --sudo-password option. For example if the sudo password is
      in the environment variable $CHEF_RUN_SUDO_PASSWORD, you could use:

      --sudo-password $CHEF_RUN_SUDO_PASSWORD

  CHEFTRN004:
    text: |
      Incorrect sudo password provided.

      Please ensure that the password you provided with "--sudo-password" is correct.

      sudo requires tty on this system

      In order to continue, sudo must be configured to no longer require tty.
      You can do this by modifying /etc/sudoers:

      For all users:
        Defaults !requiretty

      Per-user:
        Defaults:username !requiretty

  CHEFTRN007:

      No authentication methods available.

      Try...
      - Provide a password with "--password PASSWORD"
      - Provide a key with "-identity-file PATH/TO/FILE"
      - Enable ssh-agent and add keys
      - Add a host entry to your ssh configuration

      The target does not have chef-client installed.

      This command is powered by the Chef client.  In order to make use of it
      on this node, the Chef client must be installed first.

      Re-running this command without the '--no-install' flag will
      automatically perform the installation.

  CHEFINS003:
    text: |
      The target has an older version of Chef client installed.

      The target has version %1 installed, but this command
      requires a minimum version of %2.

      Please upgrade the Chef client on this node to version %2 or later.

  CHEFINS004: |
    The target's installed version of Chef Client is too old.

    Version %1 is installed, but this command requires a
